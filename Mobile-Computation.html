Well let me try to make this mistake knowledgeable for you.<br>
Ever tried finding out the tree whose apple fruit you ate yesterday ?<br>
Or in other words,<br>
	Have you ever tried to find out the smart history of the smart phones in the hands of these smart people?<br>
Let me help you out with this one.<br>
Have a look at the history of <b>MOBILE COMPUTATION :</b>

                                    <h2>Zeroth Generation (0G)</h2>
                                    <p style="text-align:left;">
                                      Mobile radio telephone systems preceded modern cellular mobile telephony technology. These are referred to as 0G or pre-cellular mobile telephony technology, and were introduced in 1970s.These mobile telephones were usually mounted in cars or trucks, though briefcase models were also made. MTS (Mobile Telephone System), IMTS (Improved Telephone Mobile System) and AMTS (Advanced Mobile Telephone System) are headed under 0 G. This generation was followed by 0.5 G which was a group of technologies with improved features than 0G. HCMTS (High Capacity Mobile Telephone System) and Autotel, or PALM (Public Automated Land Mobile), ARP (Autoradiopuhelin car Radio Phone) come under this generation.
                                    </p>





                                    <h2>First-Generation (1G) Mobile Phones: Analog Voice</h2>
                                   <p style="text-align:left;">

                                     <ul>
                                       <li>AMPS (Advanced Mobile Phone System), invented by Bell Labs and first installed in the United States in 1982. It was also used in England, where it was called TACS, and in Japan, where it was called MCS-L1.</li>
                                       <li>In all mobile phone systems, a geographic region is divided up into cells, which is why the devices are sometimes called cell phones. In AMPS, the cells are typically 10 to 20 km across; in digital systems, the cells are smaller. Each cell uses some set of frequencies not used by any of its neighbors.</li>
•	Several different systems were developed, and three have been widely deployed. DAMPS (Digital Advanced Mobile Phone System) is a digital version of AMPS that coexists with AMPS and uses TDM to place multiple calls on the same frequency channel. It is described in International Standard IS-54 and its successor IS-136.                                     </ul>
                                   </p>

                                      <h2>Second-Generation (2G) Mobile Phones: Digital Voice</h2>

                                        <li>GSM (Global System for Mobile communications) has emerged as the dominant system, and while it was slow to catch on in the U.S. it is now used virtually everywhere in the world. Like D-AMPS, GSM is based on a mix of FDM and TDM. CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), described in International Standard IS-95, is a completely different kind of system and is based on neither FDM nor TDM. While CDMA has not become the dominant 2G system, its technology has become the basis for 3G systems.</li>
                                      </ul>

                                      <li>Many operators have taken cautious steps in the direction of 3G by going to what is sometimes called 2.5G, although 2.1G might be more accurate. One such system is EDGE (Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution) which is just GSM with more bits per symbol. The trouble is, more bits per symbol also means more errors per symbol, so EDGE has nine different schemes for modulation and error correction, differing in terms of how much of the bandwidth is devoted to fixing the errors introduced by the higher speed. EDGE is one step along an evolutionary path that is defined from GSM to WCDMA (UMTS).</li>
                                      <li>Similarly, there is an evolutionary path defined for operators to upgrade from IS-95 to CDMA2000 networks.</li>
                                      <li>WCDMA uses 5-MHz channels and CDMA2000 uses 1.25- MHz channels.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                        <li>The future 4G infrastructure are aimed to consist of a set of various networks using IP as a common protocol so that users are in control, because they will be able to choose every application and environment.</li>
                                        <li>New 4G networks are designed to provide a wide variety of new services, such as high-quality voice to high definition video to high-data rate, and smoother and quicker handoff and will focus on ensuring seamless service across a multitude of wireless systems and networks.</li>
                                        <li>The 4G technology is designed for seamlessly integration terminals, networks and applications to meet ever increasing subscriber expectations.</li>

                                        <li>The key concept is integrating the 4G capabilities with all of the existing mobile technologies through advanced technologies. Applications adaptability and being highly dynamic are the main features of 4G services of internet to users.</li>
                                        <li>4G systems will interoperate with 2G and 3G system as well as with digital (broadband) broadcasting systems.</li>
                                        <li>4G systems will be fully IP based wireless Internet. This all-encompassing integrated perspective shows the broad range of systems that the fourth generation intends to integrate from satellite broadband to high altitude platform to cellular 3G and 3G systems to WLL (wireless local loop) and FWA (fixed wireless access) to WLAN and PAN (Personal Area Network) all with IP as the integrating mechanism.</li>
                                        <li>With 4G a range of new services and models will be available. These services and models need to be further examined for their interface with the design of 4G systems.</li>
