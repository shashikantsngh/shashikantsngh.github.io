                                     <h2>Introduction to Scrum</h2>
                                    <p style="text-align:left;">
                                      Scrum is one of several techniques for managing product development, under the broad category of Agile Software Development. Agile methodology is designed to support iterative and flexible methods for running a product. <br> <br>
Among the diverse agile methodology, Scrum is well defined for the types of organizations that develop products such as software, websites and Information Technology tools. Scrum encourages a team to work in a focused way for limited period of time on a definite amount of work. It also allows the team to build and improve ability to estimate how much effort it will take to develop a new feature and the lesson learnt are documented in a system

                                    </p>


                                    <h2>Scrum Origin</h2>
                                    <p style="text-align:left;">
                                      At the time, the most suitable approach for software development was the Waterfall Model. Under the waterfall model, product development happens in stages- Design, Implementation, and Release. <br><br>
In the late 1990s, the electronic media and the Internet emerged. To support these, software development organizations had to incorporate more flexibility to adapt to changing variety of platforms with different requirements. Soon after that, the development of large software applications that lived on desktop computers gave way to smaller, more flexible apps that were delivered through mobile devices. An identical approach was needed for developing these. Scrum came into picture to work together in a sustainable and productive way, instead of waiting until the entire cycle has completed

                                    </p>

                                    <h2>Scrum - The Hottest Project Methodologies</h2>
                                   <p style="text-align:left;">

                                     Acquiring the knowledge of a new language is one of the initial steps in acquiring a new skill and consistent use of language is fundamental to team trying to work together. There are a few terms defined in the Scrum to understand its meaning clearly, they are:<br>
                                     <b>Agile:</b> It is a set of software development practices designed to help developers work together and adapt to changes quickly and easily.<br>
                                     <b>Customer:</b> Whoever has engaged the team to create a product.<br>
                                     <b>Developer:</b> A person responsible for creating and maintaining the product.<br>
                                     <b>Product Backlog:</b> A constantly evolving list of potential features or changes for a project.<br>
                                     <b>Product Owner:</b> A person who helps define the product for the team.<br>
                                    <b> Scrum Master:</b> A person responsible for maintaining the artifacts and overseeing the rituals of scrum.<br>
                                     <b>Sprint:</b> A fixed number of days during which the team can work together to produce an agreed upon set of changes to the product.<br>
                                     <b>Story:</b> A clear and consistent way of dividing, phrasing, and discussing work the team may need to do on the product.<br>

                                   </p>

                                      <h2>Fail Fast Technique</h2>
                                    <p style="text-align:left;">
                                      Scrum wants you to fail. In fact, it's known for the slogan "fail fast". No, I'm not joking. It sounds weird, but there is a very good reason for this. Traditionally, project managers and developers would work for months or years before seeing the results. Most of the time, around 80% in fact, the software and projects failed. So, why, you might ask, are they signing up for more failure? Well, really, they are not.<br>
                                      The trick is in focusing on the second word: Fast. Failure is okay as long as you are learning from it, but if you have to wait too long, you are not going to learn nearly as much from it. Scrum takes the Agile manifesto and its key principles boils them down to a very simple framework that encourages small-scale focus and rapid learning cycles.

                                    </p>

                                    <h2>Agile Principles</h2>

                                    <p style="text-align:left;">
                                      Waterfall as a methodology, is not a bad thing. In few cases it makes good sense, like to start building construction, where a defined set of steps, when implemented in order, will result in a building.<br>
                                      Factual work is more like a science experiment. You try something, check out the outputs and if it didn't work for you, try some other approach. You surely can't do that when constructing a house, but with software or some other product, you can do it every day. That's why waterfall didn't work well for software development.<br>
                                      You literally cannot upfront plan the process of discovery. The frustration of highly skilled software developers working on Waterfall projects was the tipping point that led to the Agile revolution.<br>
                                      Have a look at the Agile Manifesto and it's underlying principles. This group of innovators supported this manifesto with 12 key principles. This manifesto and the principles became the foundation for a new set of project management and software development methodologies.<br>
